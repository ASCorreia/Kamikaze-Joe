# :video_game: Chainstrike 
Welcome to the Chainstrike repository! Chainstrike is a fully on-chain game that showcases an exciting arena-based gameplay experience where players compete against each other. This repository contains the necessary code and assets to run the game, which includes both the state and logic on-chain, as well as a Unity client used for engine rendering.

# :gear: Game Mechanics 
In Chainstrike, players find themselves in an arena where they must strategically navigate and outmaneuver their opponents. The game revolves around managing energy to make movements and gain an advantage. Each movement in the game costs a certain amount of energy, and players can only move if they have enough energy to spend.

The game map features chests scattered throughout, which serve as energy rechargers. By reaching and interacting with these chests, players can replenish their energy reserves, enabling them to make additional moves. It's crucial to plan your movements carefully and make the most efficient use of energy to outlast and outwit your opponents.

To make a move, players must decide how much energy they want to spend, selecting a value from 1 to 5. The chosen energy expenditure determines the number of cells the player will move, assuming there are no obstacles in the way. Strategic decision-making is key, as players must balance the need for speed and positioning with the limited energy available.

# :wrench: Technical Details 

Chainstrike demonstrates that even with the same throughput of the blockchain, it is possible to achieve visually different speeds. The game achieves this by utilizing the Unity engine for rendering, which allows for smooth and visually engaging gameplay experiences.

The repository includes the following components:

- Program: contains the game implementation for Solana 

- Unity Client: Contains the Unity project that serves as the game engine and handles the rendering of the game world. The Unity client interacts with the program deployed on the blockchain, allowing players to see the game state in real-time and make moves accordingly.
